# PikaFlik - A website for friends who love movies.

##  Built with Bootstrap, Firebase, jQuery and API calls to themoviedb.org.


A website to help groups of friends decide on what movie they want to watch by voting on a common list of movies and seeing which movies get the highest votes from your friends.


### How it works

1. Decide on Genre and year range of movies that your whole group of friends will vote on.
